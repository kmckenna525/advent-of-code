# 2021 Day 21

Part 1: straightforward

Part 2: this looks like a visit to a bajillion nodes on a tree, I guess DFS style? 
My recursion was jank so rewrote as iterative - but then I forgot memoing doesn't really work on iterative as easily and it was too slow. AND THEN there was something wrong with my solution when I rewrote it. UGH
