# 2021 Day 18

Part 1: It's a binary tree but I want to avoid implementing one ughhhhh... yeah I just gotta... took a long time to debug little mistakes but got there
Part 2: pretty easy with this basis - really screwed up and didn't realize until late that my reduce affected the inputs. So I remapped on every check and that fixed it. I don't know how to permute any faster than this - but 8sec is fine
