Part 1: I realized it's just binomial coefficient based, but I think that just made it harder. I have a fast solution but it took me a while to get there

Part 2: Super easy change and still pretty fast. My heuristics for the search space appear to be pretty good and the calculation is fast


#### General Time Estimate
- Part 1: ??? - bounded by the size of the target, since I base the search space on the target, so at least not infinite
- Part 2: ???

#### Benchmarks
- Part 1: **30.562162ms**
- Part 2: **327.977180ms**
