# 2021 Day 16

Part 1: Just took forever, but I got it
Part 2: Easy peasy after part 1, just write the recursive evaluation. I pity those not doing OOP

General Time Estimate
- Part 1: θ(n) just read the hex string piece by piece, I think twice because it pushed the bits and then reads them
- Part 2: θ(n) same, just one extra recursive loop over all packets, and that is guranteed smaller than the input

Benchmarks
- Part 1: **12.593985ms**
- Part 2: **12.884855ms**
