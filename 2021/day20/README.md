Part 1: So this was pretty easy with existing Map2D and Coord that I made for other solutions this year! Just needed to iterate and create a new map on each step. Just took a while being a perfectionist lol

Part 2: My solution still worked in a reasonable amount of time; I'm not sure how to speed it up.
