Moslty copied from other game of life solutions I've had since I did some 2020 stuff first

General Time Estimate
- Part 1: θ(n) It's huge but a finite amount of neighbors each time, so we just loop through the whole matrix * neighbors
- Part 2: θ(n)

Benchmarks
- Part 1: **2,862.86ms**
- Part 2: **2,886.23ms**
