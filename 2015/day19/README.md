# 2015 Day 19

General Time Estimate
- Part 1: θ(n) 
- Part 2: θ(n * m? n is length of medicine and m is number of replacements?) Trying all replacements one by one in order ended up being basically immediate. This would definitely not work for any invalid or suboptimal inputs. I don't think this solution actually works completely - just for this instance.
