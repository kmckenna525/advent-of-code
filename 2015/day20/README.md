# 2015 Day 20

Part 1: # of gifts is the sum of all possible unique factors (x10). (Redid with raw sim and storing and it was faster, halved the calculation time)
Part 2: Looks like raw simulation of visits is better (and actually yeah, unique factorization takes a long time) - just added a different iteration style for the houses visited to part 1's solution
