# 2020 Day 20
- Part 1: Because the edges of the result grid are unique, any tiles that only has two edges matching other tiles is a border piece. Use this knowledge to identify corners. Fuck, reading part 2 I still need to do the actual puzzling lol... Also did not realize every edge has only one match. Thought I needed to solve for an arbitrary possible number of matches. Much easier than I expected - I overengineered this 
- Part 2: At first assumed only one monster per set of 3 rows - I was wrong. Had to check all rows
