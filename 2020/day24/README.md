# 2020 Day 24
Took too long for me to realize that I was relying on a generator to intialize neighbors but I wasn't actually looping through it so it did literally nothing XD
Otherwise would have gotten a much better placement! 

General Time Estimate
- Part 1: Î¸(n) where n is number of lines 
- Part 2: O(2^n) where n is number of iterations, because each iteration adds some number of new tiles and grows the grid?

Benchmarks
- Part 1: **13.46ms**
- Part 2: **8,551ms**
