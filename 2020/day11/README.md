# 2020 Day 11
Had a lot of trouble with creating an empty grid in python, wanted it to be essentially inline but there was no way to do so. Tripped up on need to preserve the grid until after decisions were made as well. Other than that I just spent a crap ton of time on looking at generators and how they work in order to do the neighbors function. It really paid off in part 2!
