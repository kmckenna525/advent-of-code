- Part 1: Got the wrong answer on my first attempt - I was getting the length of the line *including* the line break. Needed to strip the input to get the correct wrap value. 
- Part 2: Because I made the slope variables it was pretty easy to convert to a function. Then I just called it 5 times and multiplied.
