# 2020 Day 7
This screamed some kinna linked list/graph to me from the beginning. Took a while just to figure out how to parse the input though. Not sure how to begin optimizing this... I might come back to it later. The regexes probs aren't great

General Time Estimate
- Part 1: θ(n) to parse input, O(n) to count parents - assuming input has no loops
- Part 2: θ(n) to parse input, O(n) to count children - assuming input has no loops

Benchmarks
- Part 1: **16.144037ms**
- Part 2: **15.204906ms**
