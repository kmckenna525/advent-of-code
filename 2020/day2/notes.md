# Day 2
Only interesting decision was to use a regex to parse the input format. I prob could have just prepped the input into a different format, but I like playing with regexes. I benchmarked the parsing with the function this time. Idk what's actually better.
Misread the criteria on the first try for part 2 - didn't realize it was xor
