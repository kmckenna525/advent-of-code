# 2022 Day 14

Part 1: I spent a lot of time getting the debug printing juuuust right. And then remembered I'm trying to go fast lol. Otherwise pretty straightforward once I had the input all parsed in. I thought about using ray tracing/intersections and then realized that's majorly overdoing it. 

Part 2: The debug printing helped me because it gave me the max y value to use.
