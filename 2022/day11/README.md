# 2022 Day 11

Fell asleep early last night so stats are garbage. I never like the modulus ones for some reason, maybe because it doesn't come to me as naturally. The solution explained all the prime numbers in the input at least lol

#### General Time Estimate
- Part 1: θ(n) n is number of rounds - iterating the same amount each time 
- Part 2: θ(n) same dealio, but the big numbers slowed it down without the limiting via modulus

#### Benchmarks
- Part 1: **3.087997ms**
- Part 2: **911.955118ms**
