# 2022 Day 5

A little buzzed so not my best time, but I eventually got on track for it

#### General Time Estimate
- Part 1: O(n^2) because pop(0) and insert are θ(n) and we're doing it around n times at least. θ(n) overall if I'd used a linked list stack... maybe later
- Part 2: same but maybe a little faster since it's 3 at once

#### Benchmarks
- Part 1: **3.856182ms**
- Part 2: **3.486872ms**

#### Stats
