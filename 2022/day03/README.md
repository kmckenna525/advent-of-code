A very straightforward day 3!

#### General Time Estimate
- Part 1: O(n^2) per line iterating through the second half for each item in the first half. n is like, average line length
- Part 2: O(n^2) per group iterating through the entire second and third elf for each first elf item, but it's not double nested or anything

#### Benchmarks
- Part 1: **0.360012ms**
- Part 2: **0.380993ms**
