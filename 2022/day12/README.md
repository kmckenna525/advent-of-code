A*, lots of A*

I think Dijkstra's could work better for part 2 (use E as the source and build out the shortest path tree - this does a bunch of repeated work in comparison), but this still completed under a minute so I'm fine with it

#### General Time Estimate
- Part 1: O(|V| + |E|) 
- Part 2: O(|V| + |E|)

#### Benchmarks
- Part 1: **28.056860ms**
- Part 2: **5644.566059ms**
